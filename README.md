#Performance evaluation of Terapixel rendering in Cloud (Super)computing

**Introduction**

Photo-realistic terapixel visualization is computationally costly, and there have been no such visualization of urban digital twins to date, with the few terapixel visualizations that do exist focus on space rather than earth. The objective of the project was to visualize the data the collected from the IoT device by urban observatory of the Newcastle. Terapixel images provide an intuitive and open way for stakeholders to present information sets, enabling audiences to interactively search big data across multiple scales. 

In our project we have used matplotlib and seaborn for data visualization. The platform we used for the project is google colab notebook. Pandas and numpy for data cleansing and data exploration. 

**Dataset**
 
The dataset was collected from application checkpoint and system metric output from the production of a terapixel image during a run using 1024 GPU nodes. The data shows the performance of the GPU card, performance timing of the render application and the details of each image during rendering.

The dataset in our projects:
•	Application-checkpoints.csv
•	gpu.csv
•	task-x-y.csv
